Data Mining Project: Quality Of Life based on access to Public transportation and other municipal resources


This Project will investigate the quality of life with individuals in different rural areas. Public transportation is just one example of a resource that cities provide, but each city has varying degrees of accessibility and cost. Our goal will be to analyze some of these concepts to see what kind of resources effect quality of life using techniques discussed in the CSCI 5502 Data Mining course at CU Boulder.


Currently our datasets come from data.gov and will be the main source of data. We may look to include other city specific data and merge them to create a dataset across multiple regions and multiple cities.
