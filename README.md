Data Mining Project: Quality Of Life based on access to Public transportation and other municipal resources


This Project will investigate the quality of life with individuals in different rural/urban areas. Public transportation is just one example of a resource that cities provide, but each city has varying degrees of accessibility and cost. Our goal will be to analyze some of these concepts to see what kind of resources influences carbon footprints at the individual level using techniques discussed in the CSCI 5502 Data Mining course at CU Boulder.


Currently our datasets come from the Intermodal Passenger Connectivity Database (IPCD) and will be the main source of data. We may look to include other city specific data and merge them to create a dataset across multiple regions and multiple cities. 


The role of public transport and its accessibility have been greatly increasing in the recent years. Due to the issue of environmental sustainability this issue has become increasingly popular. This issue, however, is something highly specific to regions and cities in the US, where certain cities have higher access and infrastructure in place for public transport than others. In order to examine which cities perform the best in terms of carbon emissions, it could be beneficial to inspect what forms of transportation each city has available, how many people are in that city, and the amount of carbon emissions produced by that city. Insights into these factors would allow us to draw conclusions about which cities have the most sustainable models. 
This research aims to examine the relationship between public transit accessibility and greenhouse gas emissions, utilizing the Intermodal Passenger Connectivity Database (IPCD) as a primary dataset. By analyzing cities with and without strong public transportation networks, we aim to understand how transit connectivity influences carbon footprints at the individual level. Given the rising concerns about climate change and urban air quality, this research is critical in shaping policies that promote sustainable transportation solutions. 
Cities with robust public transportation systems tend to have reduced traffic congestion, lower car dependency, and lower emissions per capita. Conversely, regions with limited or no access to transit often see higher rates of individual vehicle usage, increasing per capita carbon footprints. The findings from this study will benefit policymakers, environmental organizations, urban planners, and transit agencies by making data-driven decisions to enhance transportation networks as well as mitigate climate impact. Additionally, this research can help to inform local communities and businesses about the long-term benefits of investing in public transportation infrastructure.
Various stakeholders are affected by the issue created by transit accessibility. Government agencies at all levels must consider public transit development as a part of broader urban planning strategies. Public transportation agencies are directly impacted, as they must design efficient and sustainable systems in order to meet urban needs. The automotive industry and fuel sector will also be influenced by shifts in transportation habits. Increased public transit adoption may reduce car sales and fuel consumption. Environmental advocacy groups, health organizations, and the general public are directly affected by emission reductions which are associated with enhanced public transit.
Despite the preexisting initiatives to promote public transportation, there still  remain gaps in understanding the quantitative impact on per capita emissions. Many cities have implemented measures such as expanding bus and rail networks, integrating bike-sharing programs, and promoting carpooling. However, these solutions oftentimes lack comprehensive analysis regarding their effectiveness when it comes to reducing per capita carbon footprints. Challenges such as limited funding, political resistance, and infrastructure constraints complicate the implementation of effective transit policies further. By utilizing the IPCD dataset, this research seeks to fill gaps in current knowledge and provide empirical evidence which linking transit accessibility to emission levels. This can then serve to provide actionable insights for decision-makers.
